## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension framework
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Provides testing server, build tools, etc.


### What I learned

This was a great practice exercise for mobile-first workflow - not only was there some size and scaling changes, as in previous project, there was also a layout change.
